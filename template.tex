\section{Understanding Data Science}

Data science encompasses the multidisciplinary field that combines statistical analysis, machine learning, and computational techniques and processes 
to unlock insights and knowledge from data. This involves several interconnected stages, each building upon the previous one to deliver meaningful outcomes. 
Data science is composed by the processes of data collection, cleaning, preparation, analysis, modeling, and interpretation. Let's explore each of the 
stages that compose the journey of data science:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection:} It all begins with gathering data from various sources, such as databases, sensors, social media, or web scraping. This diverse collection 
    allows for a comprehensive understanding of the subject under study and ensures a holistic view.
    \item \textbf{Data Cleaning and Preparation:} Raw data is often messy, with inconsistencies, missing values, and errors. Data scientists employ techniques to clean 
    and preprocess the data, ensuring its quality, accuracy, and reliability for subsequent analysis.
    \item \textbf{Data Analysis:} This stage involves exploring the data using statistical methods, visualizations, and machine learning algorithms. Through data exploration, 
    patterns, correlations, and insights are discovered, providing a deeper understanding of the data and potential relationships.
    \item \textbf{Modeling and Interpretation:} In this stage, data scientists build models and algorithms that encapsulate the patterns and relationships identified during 
    analysis. These models allow for predictions, classifications, or recommendations based on the data, enabling a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.
    \item \textbf{Iterative Process:} Data science is an iterative process, meaning that each stage informs the next, and insights gained from one iteration can lead to refining 
    the entire process. Feedback loops and continuous refinement are critical to enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of data science outcomes.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Leveraging Data Science}

In today's data-driven world, organizations across various industries have recognized the immense value of data science techniques in making informed decisions 
and gaining competitive advantages. By harnessing the power of data, these organizations can gain valuable insights and drive strategic initiatives. Data science 
enables organizations to gain a deeper understanding of their customers. Via the analysis of vast amounts of customer data, including demographics, purchase history, and 
online behavior, businesses can identify patterns and preferences. This insight allows them to personalize products, services, and marketing campaigns, resulting in 
enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty. By analyzing operational data, such as supply chain processes, manufacturing metrics, or logistics data, businesses can 
identify bottlenecks, streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and reduce costs. Through data science, organizations can leverage historical data to predict future 
trends and behaviors. Companies employing techniques like regression analysis, time series forecasting, and predictive modeling, businesses can anticipate market demands, 
customer preferences, and potential risks. This foresight enables proactive decision-making and strategic planning. Product development and quality improvement is another 
area in which through analysis of customer feedback, user behavior data, and product usage metrics, businesses can uncover insights to enhance product features, usability, 
and overall user experience. These data-driven improvements help organizations stay ahead of the competition but also benefits the customers who get better value for their money.\newline

However, the advances in this field not only benefit large companies, but also ordinary people all around the world in a wide variety of areas. Many significant advancements in 
healthcare have been achieved by leveraging large datasets and developing algorithms that help medical professionals make more accurate diagnoses, predict disease outcomes, and 
personalize treatment plans. Machine learning algorithms, which are another result of advances in data science, can analyze medical records, genetic data, and clinical research 
to improve patient care and outcomes. Dr. Najat Khan Chief Data Science Officer and Global Head at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson \& Johnson talked in an interview 
about how parmaceuticals are helping patients with this new tecnologies: "Imagine that a patient has a specific mutation of cancer for which there is a targeted therapy. However, currently, 
these mutations are not picked up in a routine way because they are new and therefore are not sequenced on a regular basis. But every patient gets their tumor biopsied, so what we have 
done is used data science to digitize those biopsy slides, and then we use machine learning model to predict what mutation a patient might have just from those images. The impact of 
that is to find diseases earlier in patients who could benefit from a targeted therapy and may otherwise have been missed."\cite{Robinson:2022} The financial industry has too  been 
revolutionized , enabling faster and more accurate risk assessments, fraud detection, and personalized financial advice. Via the analysis of transaction data and patterns, banks can 
detect suspicious activities and protect customers' financial assets. Data science techniques are also vital in cybersecurity to detect and prevent threats. By assessing network logs, 
user behavior patterns, and anomaly detection algorithms, governments, companies and people can identify potential security breaches and fraud attempts. This proactive approach strengthens 
cybersecurity measures and safeguards sensitive data from unauthorized access.

\section{Technical challenges of Data Science}

Looking back to the processes of data science it is possible to realize that as the size of the data to be used increases, multiple challenges arise.
Analyzing massive datasets, commonly known as big data, presents a unique set of challenges due to the volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of 
the data. While big data offers immense potential for generating valuable insights, it also requires specialized approaches and technologies to 
overcome these challenges. First of all to generate big amounts of data, multiple types of hardware are required such as sensors, microprocessors and computers
.Incrementing the amount of collection devices requires some considerable commitment and big investments that can limit the hability of most people and small 
companies to obtain the desired or needed results. After collecting the information, it is necessary to ensure the quality of the data used for the analysis. Data 
sets may contain errors, outliers or incomplete information, which can affect the accuracy of the models and the results obtained. To address this problem, multiple 
specialists are needed to select the data to be used and to filter out what is not relevant or may have a negative effects and to further streamline processes and eliminate 
repetitive tasks, data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are also being developed, including error detection and correction, imputation of missing values and 
identification of outliers.\newline

Big data often exceeds the storage and computational capabilities of traditional systems. Managing and storing massive volumes of data requires scalable infrastructure, 
such as distributed file systems and cloud-based solutions. Similarly, processing and analyzing such vast amounts of data necessitate distributed computing 
frameworks,\footnote{A distributed computing framework refers to a software framework that allows the coordination and utilization of multiple computers (also known 
as nodes) connected over a network to work collectively.} like Hadoop or Apache Spark that can parallelize computations across clusters of machines. In addition to all these 
hardware and trained personnel requirements, it is necessary to build infrastructure to house all these systems, also known as data centers. Construction requirements include 
choosing a suitable site that meets security standards, access to reliable electrical power services, access to high-speed communication networks and scalability for future expansion. 
It is also necessary to design a robust physical infrastructure that includes redundant power supply systems, efficient cooling systems for the computers that run day and night, and 
security systems to protect the equipment and stored data. According to an analysis by the UK-founded commercial real estate services company Lang LaSalle Incorporated "the 
average-powered base building (defined here as foundation, four walls and roof along with a transformer and common areas for security, loading dock, restrooms, corridors, etc…) of a 
data center facility typically ranges from 125 US-dollars per square foot to upwards of 200 per square foot."\cite{Hawkins:2022} On top of these costs, getting a data center ready to function 
with all IT capabilities can cost between "280 US-dollars per square foot and 350 per square foot."\cite{Hawkins:2022} These costs can, of course, be much higher depending on the location 
of construction as well as power and availability requirements. To provide an example, when Facebook started constructing the Prineville Data Center in Oregon USA back in 2009 the 
company invested more than a billion US-dollars to construct the 1.25 million-square-foot facility.

Data science involves extracting meaningful information from large volumes of data. Nevertheless, proper interpretation of the results can be challenging. Machine learning 
models and analysis techniques can generate complex results that require deep and expert understanding for interpretation. This is why multiple companies and governments are 
constantly looking for educated and skilled workers to help them get the right results. Another way data scientists are addressing this challenge is through the development of 
visualization methods and model explainability techniques that help understand and communicate results more effectively.

\section{The emergence of new branches of study and work}

The rapid rise of data science has led to the emergence of new fields of study and has created exciting opportunities in the job market. As 
companies increasingly recognize the value of data-driven decision making, the demand for qualified data science professionals continues to grow.
